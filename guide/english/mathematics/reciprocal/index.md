## Reciprocal

The **reciprocal** of a number <em>n</em> is its multiplicative inverse: <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub><em>n</em></sub>. Multiplying a number by its reciprocal always results in 1.

#### Example 

The reciprocal of 3 is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>.

A **reciprocal** can also be represented as a number taken to the power of -1: <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>n</em><sup>-1</sup>.

#### Example 

<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> is same as 3 to the power of -1.

You can also take a reciprocal of a fraction by flipping the fraction. 
For instance, the reciprocal of <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> is <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>.

### Note
1. The reciprocal of a reciprocal is the original number.

#### Example 

The reciprocal of 23 is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>23</sub>. Now if we take the reciprocal of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>23</sub> and flip the fraction, we get <sup>23</sup>⁄<sub>1</sub>, which is the original number.

2. If you multiply a number by its reciprocal, you always get 1.

#### Example 

The reciprocal of 16 is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>. If you multiply <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> by 16, you get 1.

3. Zero does not have a reciprocal (that is, there is no number that, when multiplied by zero, will result in 1).
